# Machine Learning Foundations

This repository contains my personal implementations and notes
while studying the theoretical foundations of Machine Learning,
mainly based on Stanford's CS229.

## Objectives
- Build a deep understanding of core ML algorithms
- Derive and implement models from first principles
- Focus on theory, optimization, and mathematical intuition

## Scope
The repository covers:
- Supervised learning (regression, classification)
- Generative vs discriminative models
- Bias–variance tradeoff
- Optimization methods
- Dimensionality reduction

All implementations are kept minimal and transparent
to emphasize understanding over performance.
